A bad car happens in stages. The Aztek concept car was a much leaner vehicle. Decent proportions. It got everybody excited. At the time, GM was criticized for never doing anything new, never taking a chance. So Wagoner and the automotive strategy board decreed that henceforth, 40 percent of all new GM products would be "innovative." That started a trend toward setting internal goals that meant nothing to the customer. Everything that looked reasonably radical got green-lit.
